## Notes 🚩
<p> We are just started and the project is still under development. </p>
<p> We are using this project for personal uses so we don't write the same code twice in different projects. Our code is developing when we need something to add for a projects we are working on and will be added step by step to our files.</p>
<p> We know that there are a lot of projects out there like Bootstrap and others, but we want to add our fingerprint to the styling world and create something amazing to other developers to remmember us. </p>

### Thank you so much in advance and we will be thankful for your support ❤
